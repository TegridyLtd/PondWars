Considering the short development time a lot of features for the demo that were included in the Development Document had to be dropped but will be implemented in the final release, had we known the deadline we would of chosen something a little different…<br><br>First to go was HDRP(High Definition Render Pipeline) and Ray Tracing as these would of taken at least a month or two for basic implementation as it would require a rewrite of all our shaders, we also decided to use a simpler water shader for the time being while I work on our HDRP shaders for final release. <br><br>I also didn't want to rush certain areas like the AI or networking so these have been left out of the build for now with a simple test scene demonstrating basic movement and turret control. A lot of the turrets extra features are already in place, like independent barrel and ammo select, multiple turret types per pod, linked heading tracking, etc.… The one feature we would of liked to see for the turrets in this build but will be in the next is predicted trajectories, but this will come when we move onto the AI system as it will also be heavily used by it.<br><br>We have a lot of network features that we want to build almost from the ground up, I have learned from personal experience this is not something that should ever be rushed as much of games development, I imagine it would take the length of the assignment to implement the IRC rfc correctly with all the required features and I do not agree in writing code just to dispose of it so some tough choice were made for the demo.<br><br>Its basic, art work is far from complete lacking AI, Customisations and a few other features and audio was just to make sure the systems work and is far from production quality. All these things take time to get done right, and they are not something I am willing to rush. I do hope you can take this into consideration when grading this project. <br><br>Submission was early as I believe the project shows I have a reasonable understanding of the Unity editor and games design. The rest of the project will be completed in due course without the sense of urgency so I can concentrate on getting it “right” instead of getting it done fast. Sound design alone can be a long task, never mind glitch free network code.<br><br><b>Key Features/Bugs</b><br><br>Easy to configure.<br>Turrets can fire different ammo for each barrel, and contain different weapon types.<br>Ammo types and turrets have there own ammo pools<br>Different Settings per barrel/turret.<br>Single and Linked Fire/Control modes.<br>Boat controller has numerous settings making it valid for all craft.<br>Cam rig has many options and usages that have also not been fully implemented in this build.<br>Modular Language support, easily add new languages by dropping in text files and adding the path to the main control file. <br>Dynamic UI, Language buttons, ship info is all drawn dynamically depending on what is found.<br>Sure there is more I have forgot about….<br><br>buoyancy does not work as expected for all meshes and can get some weird results, this will need to be reworked as is currently not acceptable for a final build.<br><br>All imported assets are contained in the Imported folder found within the project files, everything else is of my own creation.<br><br> Summary, in the end we decided to concentrate on getting our data in reliable ways that can easily be adapted later when we have more time to spend on the GUI and our base game systems in place, we would of expected to spend atleast 6 month for the first realistic prototype.<br><br>https://github.com/TegridyLtd<br><br>https://www.tegridygames.co.uk
